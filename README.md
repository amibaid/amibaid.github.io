## Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a senior at Cal High and plan to study computer science in college. I have a passion for science, math, and technology and am fascinated by the intersection of these subjects in the modern world to help solve all kinds of problems! Check out my GitHub profile to see my machine learning projects!
