## Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a junior at Cal High. I am learning Java as part of AP Compouter Science A and am also proficient with Python. I have a passion for science, math, and technology and am fascinated by the intersection of these subjects in the modern world to help solve all kinds of problems. Check out my GitHub profile to see some of my own code and programming projects!
