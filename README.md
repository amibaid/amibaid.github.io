## Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a sophomore at Cal High. I am learning JavaScript as part of AP Compouter Science principles and Python on my own. I have a passion for science, math, and technology and am fascinated by the combination of these subjects in the modern world to solve all kinds of problems. Check out my GitHub profile to see some of my own code and programming projects!

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/amibaid/amibaid.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
