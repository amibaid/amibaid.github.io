## Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a sophomore at Cal High. I am learning JavaScript as part of AP Compouter Science principles and Python on my own. I have a passion for science, math, and technology and am fascinated by the combination of these subjects in the modern world to solve all kinds of problems. Check out my GitHub profile to see some of my own code and programming projects!
